I want to remove the “Quick Access” feature completely, but KEEP the pin functionality.

Required behavior:
- Do NOT render any “Quick Access”, “Pinned”, or “Favorites” top sections.
- The UI must have only ONE bookmark list.
- Keep the pin feature enabled.

Pin logic:
- Pinned items should appear at the TOP of the CURRENTLY SELECTED CATEGORY only.
- Do NOT show pinned items outside the active category.
- Do NOT create a separate pinned section.
- Pinned items must remain part of the normal list, just ordered first.

Favorite logic:
- Favorites must NOT affect ordering or layout.
- Favorites are used ONLY as a filter inside the “Favorite” category tab.

Sorting order inside a category:
1. Pinned items
2. Unpinned items
(No other prioritization.)

Please report:
- Which file(s) were modified
- What logic was removed (Quick Access)
- Where the pin ordering logic is implemented

Do NOT introduce new UI sections, categories, or components.
